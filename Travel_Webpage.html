        <h1>Travel to France </h1>
        <p id="Best destination">London is as busy as ever for hopeless romantics, last-chancers and the in-betweens. Go one step further than a waterside view and take your date onto the canal for a <em> scenic boat ride</em> while they tuck into dinner. If the setting wasn‘t romantic enough, there are also <strong>oysters</strong> on the menu – just might want to make sure they don‘t get sea sick.</p>
